This week:
-----
0. What do each of the columns mean in the insmix.out file?

1. What is the most-used instruction for FIRESTARTER?

2. How much overhead does this pin tool add?

3. Write a program that does little more than execute a single instruction over and over again.  Measure the power necessary to execute that instruction.  Repeat for at least one other instruction (say, the one used the most by FIRESTARTER).  How much power variation is there across different instructions?
